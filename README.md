# Portfolio for a Competition
This portfolio was created for the career portfolio competition at the educational rendezvous organized by MASSUM (Youth Association of Secondary Vocational Schools of Macedonia). The main goal of this project is to stand out in the competition and the same thing happened with winning the third place.

The creator of this project focused on creating the best and most unique design possible, whilst trying to leave the best impression to the end-user.
